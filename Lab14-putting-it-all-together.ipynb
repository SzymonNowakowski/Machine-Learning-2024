        "This is our last class this semester. It responds to a request made by several students to explain the **design process** behind a complete neural network architecture.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is, frankly, a difficult task — because such a process relies heavily on **intuition and experience**, neither of which can be fully explained. They are acquired through *“dupogodziny”* — the hours you spend working, trying, failing, adjusting, and learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "I once attended a drawing school I liked a lot, and their motto was striking:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Talent nie istnieje** — *Talent does not exist.*\n",
        "\n",
        "The school owner used to explain this quite eloquently. Every artist's output quality can be described by their **personal Gaussian distribution**: some works of art are better, some worse — their spread is captured by the **standard deviation**, while their **average quality** is given by the **mean** of the distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Talent is responsible only for the initial placement of the expected value of that distribution — sure, some people naturally produce better work *on average*, when they are young and untrained. But the most important factor determining the final quality of the art is **time spent practicing** — the *dupogodziny* you put in every day.\n",
        "\n",
        "With that in mind, in this final class, I'll walk you through the **design and training** process of a neural network I most recently worked on:  \n",
        "a **regressor for predicting period length in chloroplast grana**.\n",

        "That's why the homework for the 13th class **will** put you through your own design process of trial and error. Sure, I've provided some initial suggestions — but I am also sure that you'll need to figure out what works for you and what doesn't.\n",
